# Kaggle-House-Prices-Competition

The code in this repository is my submission to the Kaggle House Prices Competition.
It is a regression problem and my submission earned me a place in the top 2% of all submissions to the competition. 
My kaggle profile can be viewed using the link below:

I have added some notes on the code in certain cells to explain some choices I made, I think this would be beneficial to understanding the code.
